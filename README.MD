# VannilaJS-Find-my-seat-4-8
Theater seats often display a row and seat number to help theatergoers find their seats. If there are 26 rows (0 to 25) and 100 seats (0 to 99) in each row, write a nested for loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.  Example output for row-seat information: output each row and seat number on a separate line  0-0 0-1 0-2 ... 25-97 25-98 25-99
